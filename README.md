# Road-Condition-Analysis
Analysis for the data on condition of roads collected with the use of Raspberry Pi. This is a part of two-part project, have a look at the data acquisition module here: https://github.com/AnshulHedau/Road-Condition-Acquisition.

# Getting Started
Have a look at the *[Road Condition Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/Dheeraj1998/Road-Condition-Analysis/blob/master/Road%20Condition%20Analysis.ipynb)* file for diving into the analysis part of the data acquired from the sensors. The data has also been visualised on a map in the *[road_analysis.html](https://github.com/Dheeraj1998/Road-Condition-Analysis/blob/master/road_analysis.html)* file.
